# BackwardChaining
People may have second thoughts concerning events that occurred regarding their physical condition. Especially when there is nowhere to inquire about the suffering they are feeling. As a result, people frequently ignore and undervalue the symptoms they are having. Most people are aware that simple treatments are not necessary for mild ailments like colds or diarrhea. The issue is that a seemingly unimportant ailment could be a sign of a major condition. As a result, in order to diagnose the signs of a disease, one must be aware of its symptoms. The application offers advice on what to do when someone experiences these symptoms, including whether they should seek immediate medical attention. This will help them diagnose the symptoms they are experiencing. This application employs the backward chaining method of inference. Using this application, disease diagnosis results can be determined through the consultation process or by accurately and speedily responding to the questions presented by the system.
# PyKE (Python Knowledge Engine)
PyKE, short for Python Knowledge Engine, is a specialized tool designed specifically for Python. It serves as an expert system interpreter and a coding framework. Pyke enhances Python's capabilities by introducing a form of logic programming. It provides an inference engine that relies on knowledge and can execute both forward chaining and backward chaining. PyKE organizes knowledge into three main categories: 
. Fact bases
. Rule bases
. Question bases
